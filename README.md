# AIDEAS-OEIS ‚Äî AI-Driven Evaluation of Arithmetic Sequences in OEIS

## üß† Abstract

OEIS (The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences) is a rich mathematical database with over 370,000 sequences. Each sequence includes formulas, references, and examples ‚Äî but many formulas are submitted manually and remain unverified or incorrect.

**AIDEAS-OEIS** aims to programmatically and intelligently verify the correctness of formulas in OEIS using a combination of symbolic computation and AI-based validation. By converting these formulas into executable functions and comparing their output against actual OEIS terms, the system can detect mismatches and flag potentially erroneous entries.

## üöÄ What This Project Does

- **Parses OEIS entries** to isolate the actual formula from surrounding metadata (e.g., author info, comments).
- **Uses AI (e.g., GPT, DeepSeekMath, Ollama)** to interpret the formula and generate code/functions.
- **Validates formulas** by comparing AI-evaluated output against OEIS-provided sequence terms.
- **Logs incorrect or failing formulas** into a structured CSV for later correction or review.
- **Supports distributed validation**, allowing global contributors to run verifications locally and sync results.

## üåç Vision

AIDEAS-OEIS aspires to become a **community-powered AI system** that improves the reliability of mathematical data in OEIS. The ultimate goal is to transform OEIS into a **verifiably accurate** mathematical knowledge base.

This project will also serve as a public research platform where:
- AI meets symbolic math
- Open-source contributors help build a stronger math infrastructure
- Mathematicians and coders collaborate on verifying and correcting formulas at scale

## üß© Technologies (Proposed)

- **C++ / Python** core for performance and flexibility
- **LLMs (GPT-4, DeepSeekMath, Ollama)** for formula interpretation and reasoning
- **Google Cloud Platform** for scalable deployment
- **CSV / Supabase / Firestore** for data collection and storage
- **Docker** for easy deployment across systems
- **GitHub** for collaboration and open-source visibility
